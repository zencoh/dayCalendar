## Work Day Scheduler

# Description
This challenge I was tasked with using JavaScript and API's to create an interactive webpage where a user can plan their day by the hour. By typing in the colored block next to the hour the user can write things for their schedule such as meeting or to do list type items, then by clicking the save icon on the right of the block whatever the user wrote is saved to local storage so that the user can leave their computer and come back later and see what is next on their schedule. I made this project to help users plan their day and be more efficent with their time. My project stands out because I went beyond the acceptance criteria and added code to keep the page up to date with the time through out the day by taking the users time left until the next hour and refreshing the page to move the color coding past, present, future time blocks to there appropriate hour. I learned how to effectively use the 'this' keyword. By simplifying my code to try and use 'this' in any area I could I became very comfortable with calling/using objects with ease.
